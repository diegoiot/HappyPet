## Motivation

A few months ago my girlfriend adopted a cat named TOM. I currently have a remote job, I spend the day in an office in the apartment, sometimes the cat would come towards me and start meowing, well it was because his food bowl was empty.
I was also thinking about what project to do to obtain the Nvidia certification, two other worlds joined and it occurred to me to train a computer vision algorithm which would detect when Tom's bowl was empty, So he is a happy cat without hunger.

# Project Overview

This is a detection system which will be carried out in different phases, one of the first is the training of the computer vision model for the detection of the empty or full bowl. The hardware used is the Nvidia Jetson Nano 4GB, which is connected to an Ezviz Wireless Wifi 1080P IP Camera (RTSP Protocol) which is installed viewing the food bowl.
